# visual-search-classifier

## Overview

This project trains 3 machine learning models to classify visual search images into categories based on the presence or absence of target objects.
These models are: Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with gaussian kernal function, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The models were trained using Python, sklearn and TensorFlow in Google Colab.

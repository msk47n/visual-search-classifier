# visual-search-classifier

## Overview

This project implements and compares three machine learning models (MLP, SVM, and CNN) to classify visual search images based on target presence. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different model architectures on the same dataset.

## Example Input / Output

### Example 1

Input:
![Example input](examples/stimulus_ss_4.png)

Output:
Predicted class: Target present 

### Example 2

Input:
![Example input](examples/stimulus_ss_8.png)

Output:
Predicted class: Target absent

### Results

## Notes

This project was developed as part of a course project. The code reflects the experimental workflow used during development.
